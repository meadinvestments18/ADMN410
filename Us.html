											<s4><u>History</u></s3>
											<p>
											    Durham House of Pets started in 2007. It was founded by Linda and Dave Carry. Their love of pets had always
											    been prevalent from the numerous pets they've had over the years. From dogs to cats to birds and horses.
											    Linda has been a vet for close to 25 years and has always had a love for animals since an early age. They
											    founded Durham House of Pets as a way to pass their love for animals to all. When it was first founded, 
											    it sold solely dog products. As the years have gone by, they have now expanded to cats and fish. As their 
											    business continues to expand they will look to bring on a wider selection of products. As the sole priority of Linda and Dave, 
											    the founders have been able to focus all their attention on the growth of this pet shop. They have helped 
											    some 50 plus college kids get a fun, well paying job. They have continued to serve the public by providing 
											    knowledgeable service to its customers. Going forward, they look to continue being an active and supporting 
											    business to the town of Durham.
